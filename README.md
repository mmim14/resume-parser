## test cases 
### to test how our algorithm works we/recruiter can rate the accuracy by judging what resumes it moves forward and what resumes it drops. Tweak the algorithm to improve the accuracy rate
#### note: the accuracy rate will be given by the recruiter as how accurately the algorithm sorted the resumes
